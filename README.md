# The Retirement Planning System `ui-service`

I initially created this project for a software design class and decided to continue updating it
to apply new things I have learned about the NextJS framework as well as software development in general.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, make sure an .env file is saved to the root directory. The .env.example file will work for running
the application locally. The [`api-service`](https://github.com/leeosbo/retirement-api-service) base url address must be provided in the .env file and the [`api-service`](https://github.com/leeosbo/retirement-api-service) must be running before the ui-service.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
